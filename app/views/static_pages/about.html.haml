      %h2 About Learnto
      %p We are building an intellectually vibrant and passionate community that cares about spreading knowledge, learning new things, and helping each other.  LearnTo is an online platform that facilities the matching of people who want to learn with those willing to teach.  LearnTo allows individuals to share whatever it is that they're good at.  This ranges from music, dance, and languages to origami, economics, and computer programming. Lessons happen in person at a local coffee shop or other public place.  Learning in person does not only enhance the experience, it also allows like-minded people inspire one another.
      %h3 The Problem
      %p For most of their lives, people learn in person with some level of personal attention.  Teachers, professors, and coaches are able to adapt material and difficulty depending on the rate at which their students are learning; questions and concerns can be taken care of as they arise.  A recent trend toward online learning has helped many people gain instruction and skills that they otherwise may not have access to.  However, there is still a gap in the learning process.  Learning new skills or talents can often be difficult and even daunting.  There are a lot of texts (blogs, videos, even courses) online but it's often hard to find the right or most helpful materials.  Moreover, it is difficult to become inspired, stay motivated, and hold yourself accountable doing it alone.
      %h3 The solution
      %p LearnTo provides a platform to find teachers who are willing to teach new and exciting skills.  Individuals are able to  learn from people in their community.  In person lessons allow for students to ask questions, or dive deeper into material or skills.  They give the teacher the ability to adapt material based on students requests or needs.  Further, students are able to learn at any level -- often it is just getting stated that is the hardest.
