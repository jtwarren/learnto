LearnTo
=======

### Abstract
We are building an intellectually vibrant and passionate community that cares about spreading knowledge, learning new things, and helping each other. LearnTo is an online platform that facilities the matching of people who want to learn with those willing to teach. LearnTo allows individuals to share whatever it is that they're good at. This ranges from music, dance, and languages to origami, economics, and computer programming. Lessons happen in person at a local coffee shop or other public place. Learning in person does not only enhance the experience, it also allows like-minded people inspire one another.

### What problem are you trying to solve? (145/200 words)
Last summer, my brother Vishnu, a medical student at UCSD, decided to learn programming like many others his age. He wanted to learn programming to broaden his horizons and bring his own ideas to life through apps and websites. Excited by his new intellectual venture, Vishnu tried using a variety of different resources - CodeAcademy, One Month Rails, Khan Academy, and many others. However, none of them worked. Time and again, he would get stuck, and frustrated as he tried to parse through challenging new material without any help from others. Unlike how he learned throughout his life, this time he didn't have any one to answer his questions, point him to the right resources, and check his understanding. In seeing this, I realized that Vishnu is representative of a large group of people who don't learn best on their own and are being left behind by online education. He, like so many of us, thrives when he has someone there to help him understand the beauty and the intuition behind what it is he is learning. Learning alone, with no one there to communicate with and coordinate with is unnatural, difficult, and ineffective for him. [cut here]

LearnTo was designed to solve this problem and connect people like Vishnu who are committed, and dedicated to learning, with people who are passionate about the topic and would love to share their knowledge.

LearnTo's solution to the problem is simple and elegant - we  connect people who are interested in learning a topic with people in the same area who are passionate about sharing their knowledge on that topic. The teachers and the students would then meet up at a local public area and learn and share with eachother. The unique facet about LearnTo is that it's designed to be free. While traditional tutoring costs nearly $70 an hour for some subjects, well outside the price range of a large majority of people interested in learning, LearnTo will be free to use to learn and teach, opening knowledge to more people than ever before. Teachers on LearnTo are not paid to teach. Our teachers teach because they have a passion, be it photography or mathematics, and want to share it with others . They also share because they want to meet new people and to give back in return for learning from the community. We strongly believe that teachers will in fact be willing to teach for free, and we've seen it in our commmunity already. We look at examples like CouchSurfing, where millions of people host others for free, Wikipedia, the Open Source movement, and Stack Overflow as proof that people will share for free if they're doing something they love.

In connecting people who want to learn and share, LearnTo recreates the physical, in person, learning experience that all of us have grown up with. As such, it provides much needed support to the scores of people who want to learn new things and aren't effective at simply learning on their own. Moreover, LearnTo gives people an outlet to share things that they've always wanted to and in doing so opens up a dazzling array of different topics and subjects to learn. Already, we have classes on incredibly unique things like Calligraphy, Bhangra, Geometric Origami, that you simply would not be able to learn anywhere else. Nowhere else is there a real outlet to share your knowledge with others around you. This is truly powerful and we believe that this is just one example of how LearnTo opens up the collective knowledge of a community to its members and in doing so opens new doors, perspectives, and horizons. 

But beyond learning, LearnTo will also help people meet other bright, talented people in their neighborhood and will thereby create real physical communities. At the end of the day, learning is an inherently social experience through which we've met many of our closest friends in college and school. LearnTo harnesses this to help people continue to meet others in their community through  fun, intellectually engaging experiences. Due to these reasons, we believe that LearnTo will take a large step towards helping people learn and explore new things and will, in the process, unlock a whole new world of knowledge waiting to be explored.


### Describe your target market and preliminary business model. (1532/500 characters)
Our initial target market is young adults, living in large metropolitan cities who've just graduated from college and are looking to continue learning and meeting new people. Our typical user loves learning and exploring new things. To her, learning new things is so important to staying intellectually engaged and excited. In fact, she has probably taken her current job because she's seen it as a great way to learn new things that she's interested in. Moreover, now that she is no longer in college and in a new area, she is looking to meet new people and find new communities as well. 

Our preliminary business model is to implement a simple credit system that will charge people who learn without teaching. Every time you teach, you gain a credit to take a class, but if you lack the necessary number of credits, you can buy them from LearnTo at a very low price of $5 or $10 per class that will keep learning affordable. We see this as a great commitment mechanism to ensure learners will complete lessons. Moreover, it will also help us promote teaching in the community. We also hope to earn revenue through driving new users to local businesses. In particular, we hope to create partnerships with local coffeeshops, and advertise them as locations for LearnTo users to go to in order to meet up and complete their lessons. Similarly, we can have rock climbing classes take place at a local Rock Climbing Gym, or Guitar lessons happen at a local music studio. We would be paid per customer sent to each local establishment.


### Who are your team members and why are they the right people to be working on this? (286/300 characters)
Dhruv - Passion for teaching, tutored extensively. Believes that the best way to empower people is through education.
Jeff - Strong technical background and loves designing and building technical systems.
Crystal - Experienced designer who makes the product beautiful and simple to use.

### The Accelerate Contest is all about creating your Minimum Viable Product. Given that semifinalists will be provided resources (such as mentorship and $1,000), what do you plan to accomplish during IAP and demo in February? (500/500 characters)
Our MVP is not just a product but also a community. Through IAP, we plan to establish a thriving community of over 200 people in the Cambridge area with at least 300 lessons exchanged. We would like to enhance the user experience on our website by making it more feature complete - location suggestion, scheduling help, and suggested lessons are some current ideas. In addition, we would to create a mobile app that would allow our young, mobile-oriented audience, to use our product on their phones.



### How do you plan to achieve the goals stated in your previous answer? (508/300 characters)
We plan to establish a foothold in Cambridge through growing through the MIT Graduate Student community (young adults, unstructured time, looking to meet new people), and through publicizing at coffeeshops in the area. We already have a partnership with Voltage cafe for free publicity, and want to expand to every cafe in Cambridge. 

For our app, we will work to create an iOS app (we're both CS majors) that extends our websites functionality and makes learning and sharing incredibly intuitive and simple.
