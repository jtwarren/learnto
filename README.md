LearnTo
=======

We are building an intellectually vibrant and passionate community that cares about spreading knowledge, learning new things, and helping each other.  LearnTo is an online platform that facilities the matching of people who want to learn with those willing to teach.  LearnTo allows individuals to share whatever it is that they're good at.  This ranges from music, dance, and languages to origami, economics, and computer programming. Lessons happen in person at a local coffee shop or other public place.  Learning in person does not only enhance the experience, it also allows like-minded people inspire on another.
