LearnTo
=======

### Abstract
We are building an intellectually vibrant and passionate community that cares about spreading knowledge, learning new things, and helping each other. LearnTo is an online platform that facilities the matching of people who want to learn with those willing to teach. LearnTo allows individuals to share whatever it is that they're good at. This ranges from music, dance, and languages to origami, economics, and computer programming. Lessons happen in person at a local coffee shop or other public place. Learning in person does not only enhance the experience, it also allows like-minded people inspire one another.

### What problem are you trying to solve? (145/200 words)
For most of their lives, people have been learning in person with some level of personal attention. Teachers, professors, and coaches are able to adapt material and difficulty depending on the rate at which their students are learning; questions and concerns can be taken care of as they arise. A recent trend toward online learning has helped many people gain instruction and skills that they otherwise may not have access to. However, there is still a gap in the learning process. Learning new skills or talents can often be difficult and even daunting. While there are a lot of texts (blogs, videos, even courses) online, it is often hard to find the right or most helpful materials. Moreover, it is difficult to become inspired, stay motivated, and hold yourself accountable doing it alone. The desire to learn dwindles and people give up on their passions.

### What is your solution to this problem? (500 words)
LearnTo is an online platform that strives to connect individualts with a desire to learn with those that are willing to teach. Lessons take place in person at a local, mutually agreed-upon, location. 

### Describe your target market and preliminary business model. (960/500 characters)
The target market is young adults who have graduated college. These individuals have left the formal education system but are still interested in learning new things. They spend a lot of time learning and learning means everything to them. When they're not learning, they're going out and meeting new people. 

The priliminary business model is based on a credit model. During initial user interviews, most people said they would be willing to pay a small rate for lessons, unless they are giving back to the community by teaching. Since we want to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible, we would offer new users 1 lesson for free and then charge a small fee per credit, and also give credits for posting and teaching new lessons. Further, we are looking to partner with local businesses such as coffee shops. We can drive traffic to these businesses, and provide coupons or other incentives in return for promotion of our service or monetary kickbacks.

### The Accelerate Contest is all about creating your Minimum Viable Product. Given that semifinalists will be provided resources (such as mentorship and $1,000), what do you plan to accomplish during IAP and demo in February? (474/500 characters)
Our target demographic, young professionals interested in learning, is a very mobile oriented group. We plan to augment our web presence with a group of mobile applications. These would mimic the web experience and allow users to find and create new lessons. In addition to building mobile products and enhancing the web experience, we are dedicated to buidling the user base and creating new avenues of growth. We hope to facilitate 200 lessons during the month of January.

### How do you plan to achieve the goals stated in your previous answer? (298/300 characters)
The web site has been built to support mobile clients. Moreover, Dhruv and Jeff are experienced in both iOS and Android development which will expedite the app creation. Partnering with local businesses requires outreach and persistence. Time will be spent partnering with high leverage businesses.
